# IAccessible2
Accessibility services framework for Microsoft Windows environments.

IAccessible2 is an accessibility API which complements Microsoft's earlier work on MSAA.
This API fills critical accessibility API gaps in the MSAA offering. IAccessible2 was created out of necessity to
produce a usable and accessible OpenDocument Format (ODF) based office suite for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
IAccessible2 is an engineered accessibility interface allowing application developers to leverage their investment
in MSAA while also providing an Assistive Technology (AT) access to rich document applications and web browsers.
The additional functionality includes support for rich text, tables, spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other
large mainstream applications.
